*HTTP Proxy –phase1- 

*proxy.c:the main and the code it self that does all the work 

*How to compile the code in the terminal :gcc -Wall -g -c proxy1.c
                                          gcc -Wall -g -o proxy1 proxy1.o
*Execute the proxy server: ./proxy1 <URL> http://www.example.com/folder/folder/file
                                           
    
*The program we write will work as follows:An HTTP Proxy that gets requests from the user and check if the requested file appears in its DB, if yes, 
the file is provided from the local filesystem, otherwise, it constructs an HTTP request based on user’s 
command line input, sends the request to a Web server, receives the reply from the server, saves the 
file locally and displays the reply message on screen.

*Issues with test script
[-] valgrind found memory leaks, check your code for allocation/freeing errors.
  There are no leaks in the code. All issues are in _dl_open(), which a memcheck bug

[-] Test with args: http://neverssl.com/index.html failed.Please check stdout_res_from_server.txt
[-] 200OK status has not been found.
  This test requires reply with HTTP/1.1, but PDF says to use HTTP/1.0, which we do

[-] Test with args: http://asnt.org:8080/Test.html failed.Please check stdout_res_from_server_v2.txt
Error:
[-] 200OK status has not been found.
  This test requires reply with HTTP/1.1, but PDF says to use HTTP/1.0, which we do

[-] File content is incorrect.
  The document is moved, to https, and that is not supported in proxy1.

[-] Test with args: http://neverssl.com/index.html failed. Please check stdout_res_from_filesystem.txt
  The headers in expected/response_from_filesystem.txt are not printed, as described in PDF.
